**Name**: Wade Pan
**Gender**: Male

Wade (Yanqi) Pan is the first-year Ph.D. student at HIT System and Storage Laboratory (HSSL) led by [Prof. Wen Xia](https://cswxia.github.io/). He received his bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China in 2022. His research interests include file system, storage system, and operating system. Especially he is interested in the design and implementation of file systems for emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) devices.
